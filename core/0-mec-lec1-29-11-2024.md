1. analysis from sys analyst
	- give {req doc}
2. db design from designer
	- gives entity relationship diag {ERD}
3. db mapping from designer {some rules}
	- gives schema 
4. impl { swe eng } scheme with a tool
	- {RDBMS=rel db man sys}
	- { ms sql server }
5. impl interface/gui { website }
6. give it to end-user

# DBMS

## in the past
- we used 
	- file based system 
		- delimited by separators {eg: `, / - space`}
		- fixed size
			- disadvantages
				- difficult searching
					- low performance
				- no shared db .. just distributed
					- long dev time
				- no relations
				- no constraints for duplications/redundancy/ integrity
					- no data quality {no (rules/order) so data might be invalid/unchecked}

## nowadays
- we have
	- standards / rules / constraints
	- data + its meta data
	- ..etc

---

- sql: structured query lang
- meta data: data about data
- entity any obj with some attribute/property
- `BI` specialist: Bussiness Intelligence ..
- `DB` 1 vs `DBMS` 2 vs ***DB system***
	- ***DB system*** = 1 + 2 + app/software/gui

# ER model / diagram
1. entity {distinguishable}
	- rectangle
2. attr {col in table}
	- elipse
3. relationship
	- diamond
we can put attr on a relationship, ***only if*** it depends on both edges

# types of attr
1. simple
	- no {seg, duplicates for same person, runtime calc}
	- elipse
2. composite
	- a & b = this attr
	- tree of elipese
3. derived
	- runtime calc
	- ***dashed*** elipse
4. multi-valued
	- `double` elipse
5. complex
	- 4 + 2

# types of entity
- strong
	- has PK + not affected by removal of another entity {indep existence}
	- single rect
- weak
	- affected by removal of another entity {dep existence} + has a composite key {owner PK + some other attr}
	- `double` rect
	- defining relationship

# relationship {rel} properties
1. degree
    - unary/recursive
      - both have same attr
    - binary 2
    - ternary 3
2. cardi
	- 1:1
	- 1:m
	- m:m
3. parti
    - total
      - must
        - 1+
    - partial
      - may
        - 0+

# types of keys
## core
- [x] candidate
	- what we think can make a PK
- [x] primary
	- the best of candidates/ the final boss
		- we usually pick the smallest datatype
- [x] foreign : a subset of the PK in another table + can be repeated + can be null
	- ***dashed*** underlined
	- links tables
- [x] composite
	- many attr that makes an artificial PK
- [x] partial
  - on a weak entity 
  - dashed underlined {ERD}

## more
- [x] alternative
	- any non PK attr
- [x] super
	- any collection of col {attr} any number
