quelling blade .. melee hero better cs
stout shield .. melee hero better lane sustain 

clarity potion .. better mana regen.. just don't take damage

low on health and mana plus no regen items? walk to fountain

whoever 2nd hit a two hit minion gets the cs
it's a mind game of pressing stop key

remember the miss chance 25% while attaching the high ground .. agro minions from enemy hero .. will pull them down for you

if enemy and ally creep are low then
cs ally and spell the n.. win twice
can also aim to hit both n hero and creep 

if supp focus on denies.. if carry out of lane , you cs instead 

aa n who tries cs .. but don't grab agro this ruins wave equilibrium .. minions must be out of an imaginary circle around you

body block early waves.. better be done on offlane .. cuz it's far from your tower

de agro on ally with a left click 

bull neutral to your ally creep if you need de push

at each 50sec mark stack a camp

cannot buy or sell neutral items
only randomly find them or share them with friends 
divided in tiers
1 @ 7 min
then every 10min
but 5 @ 60 min
cannot drop if nearby n
can be stolen 

pulling to neutral is better done by considering your minions agro range circle
you force a ranged attack (projectile) from neutrals on you .. let it connect just when your minions are in range

you can start cascade or link or connect pulls (pull through) if 2 neutrals are 100% 30% health or 60% 60%

when supp on offlane .. ward to block they enemy camp to prevent them from pulling
if de-warded.. try ruining the pull .. if not possible .. try getting exp and cs there

we harass or trade aa or spells just to make enemy run out of regen items and go out of lane .. for you to get last hits and denies and not him

on supp buy gloves of haste, regen items then boots of speed

the holy trifecta 
defense (mr , arm, hp, hp regen) force fight
, damage (aa, spells, AS) hit if close
, mobility (range, MS, cc) kite.. most valuable corner

if you start a spell animation and the enemy goes invisible or high ground .. the animation is cancelled.. so dont waste that time

body block enemy especially if you are a support

always tp out when enemy try to kill you without them having any channeling cancelling spells or items.. sometimes you must juke them in bushes first

4 more things to think about before any fight..
damage, chase, disables, gapclose 

creeps are more in gold and exp than camps


successful gank = you gain more gold and temp and pressure unlike your dead enemy

body block if no spells and disables

hex (no animation) first then stun.. and chain cc

better gank from behind.. and it's fine to walk the long ways not to get spotted by enemies and ruin your gank

learn your champ vision range + creeps + towers

use smoke of deceit to surprise enemies.. better make an invisible hero lead the smoke gank

usually maxing aoe spells is best .. to fast farm and level

pushing/ shoving waves has 5 benefits:
you spot an enemy 
know he's not ganking or tp now
you can gank now
can kill tower
can kill defender

don't have aoe +
supp? ward, roam to spot enemies, start fights
core? build aoe or illusion items

dota2
spend less time puahing waves in late games .. push just 1 wave and go back asap.. 20 sec max.. or just push with illusions

after the enemy wave dies it leaves a spot of vision for few seconds.. maneuver enemies by pretending to walk in a specific direction

walk parallel to wave not through it 

for ganks in late game .. farming enemy camps makes it faster to rotate to enemies showing up 

don't try to push turrets late game for nothing this tells enemies where you are

priority for pushing lanes to ward and de-ward on

on high ground base .. ward between turrets.. good for spotting enemies and initiating on them while de-warding

carful about enemies buybacks while you are in their base

mehcad pipe + crimson guard + aolar crest .. good supp items for pushing high ground
