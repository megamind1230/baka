> go to the website of the manufacturer of your motherboard ( don't know who is him .. use cpu-z) ... my case was dell so search for ( dell motherboard drivers )
> [Support for Latitude E6540 | Drivers & Downloads | Dell US](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/servicetag/0-b3NyUkpuU3l1WE1tZFAyQjlTd3J6dz090/drivers) this one i got

>first let the website check for updates (if it can do this)
>then download the {{compatible audio driver}}

>go with the process

> re plug in the headset jack
> you should now see the prompt (to select the type of the headset .. whether it's with a mic or not )
