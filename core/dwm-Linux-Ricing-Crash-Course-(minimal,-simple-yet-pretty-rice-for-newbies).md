#linux/arch_based

- on arch itself #linux/arch_based/obstacle/lack_of_knowledge 
	- can't proceed installing arch
	- encountered this `waiting for automatic mirror selection (reflector) to complete`
	- solution was to not use the `archinstall` script, and just do it all manually
		- [Arch Linux: A ℂ𝕠𝕞𝕗𝕪 Install Guide - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68z11VAYMS8) is the best i found on youtube (i think it was uefi + manual install)
- on arco clone
	- can't deal with startx & xorg

anyways im proceeding the video know
my xrandr resolution is 1366x768
