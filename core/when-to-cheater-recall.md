when u need to get an item advantage 
- how
	- watch out n jg
	- last hit first wave .. a little more hits on sec
	- then shove the 3rd .. that one with canon .. and crash it into turret
	- should have 400 gold .. go into bush recall .. don't move too much of the bush is far away
- the idea is canons are health enough to buy u time for ur recall
- downside ( u may lose cs due to fast shove )
- it's better to buy boots for faster back to lane

>

-  wanna siege with a connon wave .. for a crash on enemy turret .. then recall {cuz u have time untill they push the wave back}
	- like in the first 3 waves of the game {u slow push them .. the fast push the fourth/ the cannon one}
