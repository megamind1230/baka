- if your mouse is not working at all? then you can move it using the numeric pad on the keyboard .. as mentioned here

## general navigation tricks
### alt
- `alt f4` > close app
- `alt tab` > navigate windows open 
	- [[0-how-to-stop-edge-from-showing-its-tabs-when-using-alt-tab|MS edge related weird interaction]]
	- `ctrl tab` > {tab} navigate inside the current app
- `alt` > activates {menus and toolbars} in lots of apps
	- sometimes you need to press and hold {`alt`} to make it show the menus {like in kdenlive}
		- and sometimes just press {like in firefox}
	- sometimes it helps more.. by showing specific letters to trigger an option
		- also remember that: primarily `enter` /sometimes `space` > behaves like `left click`
		- `arrows` > move between items
		- `tab` > move focus
			- helps with things that arrows don't get to
		- `shift f10` > `"hamburger" or menu (three lines) key` = `right click`
### win
- `win e` > file explorer
- `win tab` > navigate workspaces .. also can switch by clicking
- `win d` > toggle hide all apps to show desktop
	- Pressing a letter then.. will prompt the selection to jump to the next item that begins with that letter.{pressing {r} selects Recycle Bin.}
		- btw: may work sometimes somewhere else
- `win x` > open the `Power User menu`
	- maybe the most cool shortcut in windows
- `win` = `ctrl esc` 
	- then you can type the app name there
## numeric pad
