#1 

- `encapsulation` 
	- the class encapsulates attr & member funcs into objs
	- objs communicate.. but not know others implementation details ***info hiding***
- `OOAD` obj oriented analysis and design
- `.cpp=.cxx=.cc=.C`
- 6 phases/steps of a cpp project
	- edit/write
	- pre-process
		- C++ preprocessor follows cmds called ***preprocessing directives***
			- tells us that certain manips {`macro replace || code from other files`} are needed before compile
	- compile
		- machine code = ***object*** code file
	- link
		- ***linker*** links object code file with messing funcs it it needs from { standard libraries | your private libraries }
	- load
		- load executable files from desk -> ***ram***
	- execute
- compile single cpp file on gnu/linux
	- `g++ -std=c++14 main.cpp -o a`
	- in my bashrc in put
		- `alias com='g++ -std=c++14 main.cpp -o a && ./a`
			- to run `./a`
				- `./` tells Linux to run from the current directory
