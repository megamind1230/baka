according to (the running patch) notes
there would be some buffs to some champs
those would make the current meta (collection of most picked & OP champs)
so some champs then rank over others in tier lists

but this is temporary {less than a month or so}
so it's better to stick to fundamentals and your main champ whatever the meta is
(if you are a good main .. you can still conquer any meta)
