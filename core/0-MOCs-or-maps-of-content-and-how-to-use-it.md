# why use it?
- flexible faster {linking} so no rigidity of the folder-based systems or (folder structures)
- help you work in {both directions}
	- bottom up 
		- > you create a note from a fleeting idea > then it finds its place and be linked into the MOC somehow
	- top down
		- > you look at the MOC graph > then find new or missing ideas that needs to be tackled
# when create one?
- either when you
	- hit the {mental squeeze point} where you find it emergent to make a MOC for these mess of related notes
	- know some {outline/points of your interest} in the topic
# 5 levels of creating one
> `rule 0`: Don't push it too hard 
> just go with the flow .. MOCs are created in an advanced stage of note-taking
1. create some isolated notes 
   {fleeting and lecture notes}
2. grow each of them more and further create other more notes + have a few links between them
   {grow your garden}
3. create the MOC
	1. dump all related notes here {no ordering}
	2. create some outline for them {simple ordering}
	3. give this current structure some time
		- maybe you can add more notes related
		- maybe you can re-structure it better
4. link between related MOCs (if possible)
   {MOCception}
5. create a HOME note to index all your MOCs 
   (optional but good and helps you see your projects)
   {MOC your MOCs} or {Indexing}
# some rules of thumb
- prefix your MOC name with some `abbreviation` or special characters but not these `# [] | ^`
	- `YT` youtube
	- `PG` programming
	- `KL` Kdenlive
- suffix with `MOC`
- from now and then.. look at the local/global graph view
