- why use regex?
	- search for data of specific format
	- replace parts of string with another
	- validate data is in a specific format
	- split string
- metacharacter = magic char
	- these must be escaped with `\` be to dealt with literally
		- `. $ ^ { [ ( | ) * + ? \`
- anchors {dealing with starts and ends}
	- `$` > end of line
	- `^` > start of line
	- word boundaries
		- I went to the store to_the_store
			- `\bthe\b` matches > the
			- `\bt` > to, the, to_the_store {words starting with t}
				- `\Bt` > went, store 
				  {has t but not-starting with t}
			- `t\b` > went
				- `t\B` > to, store, to_the_store
				  {has t but not-ending with t}
- quantifier
	- `.` > any single char
	- `\d` > any single digit
		- `\D` > any single non-digit
		- capitalizing can sometimes mean the opposite
	- `\w` > a word char {either letter, digit, `_` }
		- `\W`
	- `\s` > single white space
		- `\S`
	- `?` > 0 or 1 times `{optional}`
	- `+` > 1 or more times `{Kleene Plus}`
	- `*` > 0 or more times `{Kleene Star}`
	- `.*` > greedy
		- `.*?` > not greedy
	- `a|b` > a or b `{alternation}`
	- `c{n}` > c repeated n{which is a number} times
		- `c{n,}` > at least n times
		- `c{n,m}` > at least n, at most m
- character classes
	- some specific chars `{character set}`
		- `[abc]d` either a or b or c > ad, bd ,cd
	- range using `-`
		- `[a-z]` > lowercase
			- `[A-Z]` > uppercase
			- `[a-zZ-A]` > both
		- `[0-9]` > digits
			- `[2-4]` > 2,3,4
	- exclusion with `^`
		- `[^abc]` > a,b,c excluded `{negated char set}`
- flags or modifiers
	- `/g` global
		- when off: it will just go for first match
	- `/m` multiline
		- Regex sees all text as one line. But we use the multiline flag to handle each line separately.

	- `/i` case-Insensitive
- [capture groups](https://youtu.be/c9HbsUSWilw?si=nx8eHI1J1ukAvF6v)
	- just encapsulate the expression you want inside `()`
	- remember: `group 0` is the whole big expression
	- referencing a group
		- like the `\1`, `\2` in `(ha)-\1,(haa)-\2` applied on 
		  `ha-ha,haa-haa`
		- and use `$1` and so on when substituting
- Non-capturing Grouping {to disable referencing this group} using `?:` #still/regex 
	- [23. Understand Captured and Non Captured Groups in Regular Expression - RegEx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEGUUVvrgdo)
	- `(?:ha)-ha,(haa)-\1` on same text
		- notice that it is `\1` but not `\2` cuz the first group is disabled
- lookarounds #still/regex 
	- If we want the phrase we're writing to come before or after another phrase, we need to "lookaround"
		- positive lookahead `?=`
			- `\d+(?=PM)` on `Date: 4 Aug 3PM` > 3
		- negative lookahead `?!`
			- `\d+(?!PM)` on `Date: 4 Aug 3PM` > 4
		- positive lookbehind `?<=`
			- `(?<=\$)\d+` on `Product Code: 1064 Price: $5` > 5
		- negative lookbehind `?<!`
			- `(?<!\$)\d+` on `Product Code: 1064 Price: $5` > 1064
- substitution in regex #still/regex

> globbing = translating the wild card chars like {`* ? . ^ [some chars here]`}
- remember that `* or ?` .. does not match with the (leading dot)
	- بمعنى لو جربت تعمل مثلا `ls *something`
		- never shows something like `.vimrc` .. it has a leading dot
