I need financial aid because I am from Egypt and my income cannot pay for this course. Now I
do not have a job to pay for it, because I am still student. And I cannot find a job so that I can
cover courses fees as I am a medical student and it is hard to study medicine while working. My
father income cannot either pay for it. He is old and retired pow. So the income of my father
can only cover my academic studies in college. I always have the desire and ambition to
improve my skills but money is always my problem but when I have heard about online
courses and especially coursera and about the financial aid that coursera provides for people
cannot pay like me, I restored my hope and dream about improving myself again. So I need
your help by giving me financial aid. And I hope that you give me the chance. And finally I really
thank you
