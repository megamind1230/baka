# general shortcuts
## win
- `win w` > whiteboard
- `win e` > file manager {file explorer}
- `win r` > show run search box
- `win u` > font display & brightness lvls
- `win p` > multi-monitor display mode
- `win a` > right side panel
- `win h` > english speech recognition
- `win l` > lock screen of windows
	- sometimes makes you mad if you work with linux VM so you can turn it off
		- ![[0-how-to-disable-enable-win-l-lock-screen-on-windows-10]]
- `win m` > force hide all windows {minimize}
	- meanwhile `win d` is a toggle .. important to know the difference
		- a toggle: means that pressing the same strokes again would do the opposite
		- so sometimes it is better to learn the toggle shorcuts not the other variations
	- `win shift m` > opposite: force unhide all windows
- `win pause` > system specs
- `win shift s` > snipping tool (screenshot)
	- `win printScreen` > full screen shot (snipping is still better)
- `win ,` > sneak peak desktop
- `win .` > emojis
- `win v` > show clipboard history
- `win =` > trigger magnifier zoom
	- repeat > zoom in
		- `win -` > zoom out
- `win no.`
	- activate the app with the number {no.} in the taskbar
- `win space` = `alt shift` > switch input lang
## function keys
- `f1` > help
- `f2` > rename
- `f4` or sometimes `ctrl l` > activate address bar
- `f5` > reload
- `f6` > jump/switch between panes (if possible)
## ctrl
- `ctrl f`
	- in file explorer > activate search bar
	- in browsers > 
	  search for something in the current page
- `ctrl x,c,v,z` > cut,copy,paste,undo changes
	- `ctrl y` or sometimes `ctrl shift z` > redo
	- `ctrl shift s` > save as (first specify path and type)
		- `ctrl s` > save
	- `ctrl a` > select all
	- `ctrl p` > print (helps create pdfs)
- in your file system
	- `right click`
		- and before you click copy .. press `ctrl`
		- now you copied the {{absolute path}}
			- only pastes in file system address bar
## random
- in file system {file explorer} .. select an item then 
	- `alt enter` > property menu
		- same as `alt double-click`
- `ctrl shift esc` > task manager
- `ctrl alt del` > security menu
- `alt space` > the app system menu
- `shift del` > delete a file forever
# workspaces related shortcuts
> all have `super`/`win`
- `win ctrl d` > create new desktop
	- `win ctrl f4` > delete it
- `win ctrl left/right` > move between desktops
- `win tab` > toggle show workspaces
	- another way coming later
# gestures with the touchpad
> helpful in laptops
## 2 fingers
- `2 fingers press` > right click
	- `2 fingers pinch` > zoom
	- `2 fingers slide up, down` > scroll
## 3 fingers
- `3 fingers press`> cortana search (sometimes doesn't work)
	- `3 fingers down` > toggle show desktop
	- `3 fingers up` > toggle show workspaces
	- `3 fingers left/right` > switch apps
# while typing or editing text

## mouse navigation
- `arrow` > move by char
	- `ctrl arrow` > move cursor by word
	- `alt arrow` > move cursor by a bit wider than a word (respects encapsulators)
- `pageup/pagedown` > scrolling in file
- `end` > end of line
	- `home` > start of line
	- `ctrl home/end` > top/bottom of text {if it is a multiline text}
## selecting
> just combine the navigation thingies above with `shift`
- `ctrl a` > selects all
## deleting
- `del` > it is a `backspace` .. but forwards
	- `ctrl backspace` > delete by word
		- `ctrl del`
	- `alt backspace` > delete by history of change
		- it's it like undo-ing so to redo to just 
		  `ctrl shift z` or `ctrl y`
			- `alt del` does not work i think
