# rules
> mixed comp {mixed damage, tanks, wave clear, reliable engage cc}

> jg + laner = damage, cc setup { for better ganks }

> the mojor winning synergy must be between ...  jg and supp > cuz they roam for help, setup fights { engage, cc }

> laning phase ends when turret plating falls {about 14}

> understand win-condition : { early-game-snowball / teamfighting / scaling / split-pushing }

> watch out meta

> counter / meta / otp ban
