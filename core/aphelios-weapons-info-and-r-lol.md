## green
> `good all phases`
- range ~= cait range
- `q`
	- best early game poke/dps with animation cancel
		- `AA q` st `AA` st `AA`
			- so you proc the mark faster by just `st`
	- invis n marked with `q` are revealed 
	- to check bushes
	- triggers `OHW`


## red
> `strong late` game
- `AA` 
	- can damage yasuo/samria behind their wall
	- weak early/mid game, strong late
- `q`
	- prio n even if they are inside the wave .. ***careful to use it under n turret***
	- gives `MS` .. so good for escapes
	- locks all ur abilities


## purple
>  `good all phases`  { but has slowest AS }, roots {for team/to run}
- `AA` slows .. so better hold on `q` if n escapes
- `q`
	- can activate `q` before it actually connects


## blue
> `strong late` game
- `AA` 
	- is 2nd safest weapon to poke with
- `q` 
	- longer range than `AA`
	- triggers `OHW`


## white
> `strong` in every phase
- `AA` 
	- is slow from far, faster when close
	- cannot dps until they swing back
- chakrams 
	- `20` max
	- stacked with only `q` or `R`
		- lost 
			- after `5sec` .. unless reset with `AA` or whatever
			- against yasuo `wall` , samira `slash` , braum `shield`
	- [ ] best way to stack them ? #quest
- `q`
	- [x] triggers `OHW`
	- prio n first
	- good for zoning n / melee fights
	- can be placed over wide walls
	- un-targettable if n dont walk into it


## R
- can only `f R` âœ…
- `AOE` range is wider than you think
	- so `R` the close enemy .. to mark and kill the far one
- triggers `main` weapon
	- green > you have 4 dps sources `at least` > quickly `qR AA AA`
	- red > better healing with more n
	- purple > set up `roots` for team > if you are behind in game
	- blue > ***best*** `AOE`, better with more n
	- white > ***2nd best***, only good for just stacking chakrams
		- 5 for first enemy being hit
			- 1 extra for each
			- so hitting 
				- 5 gives {`5 + 1*5 = 10`}
				- 3 gives {`5 + 1*3 = 8`}
