- general
	- minimap movement trick from {midbeast}
		- https://youtu.be/i4duvWv1ZdQ?si=6W1CTNdCAU8W4PZv&t=280
	- items
		- Dark seal 
			-  good vs sion 
			- Good on varus , jax , twitch , Yuumi , janna
		- armor boots vs warden's mail
			- boots better when high damage per aa but not so many aa 
			- WM better when low damage per aa but so many aa ( sometime vs zeri , urgot )
	- csing
		- depends on 4 factors
			- ur missle speed & enemy minions distance from u & ur minions dps on that enemy minion & ur missle damage
			- just be close to get rid of the first 2 factors
		- use S
		- csing under turrets
			- know the order
			- know the number of turret shots to kill minions
			- hit right with the turret shot
		- watch vods to know when u drop some
	- runes
		- pta can be proced by abilities
	- If u kill 4 darke .. u get the dagon soul .. perma buff
	- when n wave is on ur side & u kill the n > shove wave
	- always input movement commands in between aa commands (don't let's ur champ auto follow n ) ... it increases dps
	- picaxe > sheen
	- when n wave on ur side + no n in lane > shove wave
		- when n wave on ur side + n in lane > freeze , last hit , and zone
	- scuttle crap vision top side ( u can sneak in the top part of it .. hang the wall )
	- potions & health
		- sometimes u get {doran shield and second wind rune} plus some potions .. if ur a melee vs a ranged .. it's better to use potions last
		- as these 2 scale with ur missing health (heal more on low health)
		- so u can bait mana champs to waste their mana on u { but keep out of there aa range } .. till ur low { so u proc the doran shield & second wind & potion} for the most health regen .. jump on them with ur mana and kill them
	- laning phase
		- first 3 melee minions die at 1:55 by default
			- if ur n leashes his jg .. if he comes fast might catch these 3 
			- so if u want him to miss 1 of them at least .. let the waves face together .. aa a backline caster then back .. this makes some melee + the casters target u
			- but when u back .. there reset into 1 melee minion of yours .. to fast kill it
			- so it's lost for ur n to get it
	- fake recall
		- recall at the tip of the bush where n can still see u .. and right before it's completed .. move into the bush .. use fog of war (FoW) .. sneak and kill him off guard

# role notes

- jg
	- green default > shield
	- red > damage
	- blue > speed
	- when flank > use sweepers
	- blue buff is more important
	- after clearing the camps look for a gank
		- melee vs melee top & supp > help bush (don't gank if large wave)
		- melee vs ranged top > flank if too inside
		- mid lane > flank if too inside
	- trace spells
	- drake at 5 always down >> every 5 mins from slain
	- rift always up >> take if enemy gank bot
	- scuttle at 3:30 both > when both killed respawns in a random river (2nd is better)
	- check the q+smite amount of damage
	- shuf the wave when top killed enemy has a tp
	- when enemy gank the other side ur in > gank here
	- @warwick
		- q through by moving the mouse the other way
		- w used before combat for AS and MS
