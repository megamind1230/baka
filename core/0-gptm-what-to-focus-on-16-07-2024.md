	- methods of studying/note-taking
		- 2nd-glance
			- just watch/read again and again
		- paper-pencil
			- dont write every single thing .. just
				- main keywords
				- relations
				- timestamps
				- questions
				- your ideas
			- search the unknown
			- keep the paper to study from
		- voice notes
			- good capturing method
			- valid if you no imgs needed
			- bad if your tt speed is faster + has a lot of word fillers
		- outline
			- = unordered list
		- mind map
			- better than outline in visualizing the big picture of larger schemas
		- the flow
			- everything consists of some atomic info/ideas .. recognize them one by one .. immerse yourself to study as many of these as you can
			- best way to test what you learned is by doing exercises / solving problems
				- dont take so much notes .. just sometimes
				- try-error is your best friend
		- write-on-slide {or pdf}
			- search the unknown
			- sticky notes explaining parts you find unclear
			- keep the pdf on your pc
		- feynman technique
			- study then explain to someone ..try to make them understand
		- spaced repetition & active recall
			- ex: use anki
		- zettelkasten {a more comprehensive knowledge} {you can do any of the above}
			- core steps
				- capture ideas {fleeting notes, lecture/literature notes}
				- refine .. take your time {explain/search the unclear to you .. make it understandable + write them in a nice format + draw it + add imgs}
				- merge or split
					- merge the note with other related notes OR just link if this note is big
					- split the note if it is big + have big sub-topics
				- view the graph .. link and fill in the gaps
					- you now see the whole picture 
						- you can link more between related notes
						- you can create new notes that complete the topic
			- obsidian helps with every step
	- websites+flash courses that helps yall in your tracks
