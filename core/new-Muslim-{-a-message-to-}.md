Assalamu alaykom brother👋👋🙋‍♂️😁, I've watched some of your videos published almost a year ago  
And what caught my attention in a video.. is that you said to your viewers something like you need some help to learn more and more about Islam 🤔  
So, this is the channel of {{{Sheikh Othman Farouq}}} an English content😃  
  
@OneMessageFoundation  
The id of the channel 👆  
  
I think you  can also find a way to contact with him or his team if you need help... their website is attached to the YouTube channel  
Maybe you're gonna spend some time there.. don't panic and take it easy .. learn it byte by byte  
Just watch the videos on a regular basis 👍👌  
⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️  
⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️But what's is also {{{soooooo important}}} is that you need to keep tracking of all the new information you get about Islam/ make connections about them / easily retrieve them/ organize them easily .... so maybe you'll need some software like {{{{Obsidian/ Notion}}} to manage your knowledge database.. I personally recommend Obsidian as it's more flexible, offline-based and more customizable  
May Allah guide you my brother 🤲🤲  
Wallahi I'll be more than happy if this helps you... 😁😃
