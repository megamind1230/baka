	Commands:
	:ls (shows open buffers. %a is the active buffer, # - prev buffer used )
	:bn (switch to buffer #n, :b# is the prev buffer)
	:b partialMath (supply part of an open file name. tab thru list if more than 1)
	:n file(s) (add new files)
	:n
	 (go to next file in the list)
	:prev
	 (go to previous file in the list)
	:find filePattern
	 (find a file contained in vimâ€™s path variable. tab thru list if more than 1)
	```
- [ ]  Split windows or Multiple Tabs

	:split
		ctrl w s
	:vsplit
		ctrl w v
	ctrl w hjkl
		move between splits
	:split fileA.html
	:vsplit fileB.py
	:tab ball
	(display files in n panes split horizontally)
	(display files in n panes split vertically)
	(display files with tabs. Maximum 10)
	(current file displayed again in new pane)
	(current file displayed again in new pane)
	(horiz split current pane and add another file)

	cs'" to change the surrounding
	ysaptli> surround paragraph with <li> tag
	S{char} surround selection
	```

	- `:g/^$/d`
	- :g will execute a command on lines which match a regex. The regex is 'blank line' and the command is :d (delete)
# neovim manual
- `:help index` show all cmds
- `:help pattern.txt` learn [[0-regex-or-regular-expressions-MOC|regex]] from vim
- `/the\>` will match ***the*** but not `there`
	- `\>` end of word
	- `\<` start of word
- [x] 56
nvim X vs x

vim
    `gv` > re-select last selection
    insert mode
        `ctrl h` > delete 1char back
        `ctrl w` > delete 1word back
        `ctrl u` > delete till line start
    vim fileName +number > open and go to this line number
    this better works with {non relative line numbers}
         wanna copy line 17 to the line below ur cursor {cursor on 10}
               `:17t.`
    open 2files into splits
         `vim -o f1 f2` > hori
         `vim -O f1 f2` > vert
    copy a whole func
         `vim.keymap.set("n","YY", "va{Vy",opts)`
    open nvim with a specific config
         `nvim -u path/to/config`
         `nvim -u none`


insert mode
       auto complete > ctrl p/n
append more to a word
       `:%s/word/&addtion/g`
delete selection and replace it with the thing on the clipboard {without losing the thing in the clipboard}
       `xnoremap <leader>p "_dP`
                 cuz u delete into the blackwhole reg "_"
motion+regex
    `d/someword` > deletes till that word in file

insert mode
       `ctrl n/p` or `ctrl xi` > single word complete
       `ctrl xl` > identical lines complete

easy 1 to 10 in vim
    `1<Esc>yy9pV9j g ctrl a` > 1:10


make last line in screen view {not in whole file} centered >
	`L zz`
	`ctrl d M`
	`ctrl f zz` almost
