- blind pick > just choose ur champ without knowing ur n picks (being blink of what they chose) (no roles assigned .. so there might not be jg XD) .. go into a rift
- draft pick > now u have a draft and see their picks .. rift
- aram > go into a midlane shaped rift .. easier gold .. a lot of fights
- ranked > it's draft but more formal and u go up / down in rank (at most close MMR players)
- flex > it's ranked (but very differnt MMR players) #still/lol
