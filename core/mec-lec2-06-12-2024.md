- [x] entity in ERD = always table in schema ?
	- now 100% cuz attr can create a table {multi-valued case}
	- entity can be mixed with another in same table
- [x] entity can not have relationship ?
	- no

---
- foreign key: PK in another table
	- can diff in name
	- same datatype? of course YES
	- arrow from another to PK
	- can have NULL, duplicates 
---
- record = row = tuble
- col = field = `attr`
---
- constraints doc
	- tells 
		- composite attr parts
		- derived attr
- ERD mapping
	- first to look for 1:1 total
- multi-valued -> create table {now the PK = composite}
- arrow from child to parent { head to PK }
