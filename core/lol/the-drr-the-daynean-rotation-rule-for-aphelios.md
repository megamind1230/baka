> this rotation unlocks some new/underrated weapons combos


- finish:
	- `red` first
	- `green`
	- be low on `blue+purple` almost equally then {finish blue first}
		- so you get purple white {good for running away and roots}
		- then dropping purple give ***red white***
	- `red` again
	- then `white`
> this gives you ***blue+green*** which is the heavy-machine-gun combo


- [x] ***blue green*** >> the `heavy-machine-gun combo`
	- can only get these 2 weapons if you followed THE `DRR`
	- has at least  4 damage resources
		- `blue AA q AA AA`
		- can squeeze 6 damage resources by just switching to green q
			- `blue AA q AA AA green q AA`
	- can proc kraken slayer
	- can do it 4+ damage resources combo by either
		- having enough `AS` {tier 2 AS boots, 2 AS  items, stats AS upgrade}
		- or  you have enough `distance` between you and the target .. so the mark would take time to travel and land on the target
			- the more the better
	- if n is inside a wave
		- `blue q` then `AA` him
			- will consume all the marks onto him only

- [x]  ***red purple*** >> MEGA slow and root with MEGA DPS { late game }
	- `red q purple AA` till then try to run then `q`
