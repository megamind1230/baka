# weapons rotations
- the idea behind `weapons rotations` is to have an idea what are the next weapons so you change your playstyle accordingly .. nothing else
	- it's always better to know you next step and not make it random

> THE `GRR` :  
> 	- finish `red` whenever possible
> 	- then the `oldest` weapon you have

> THE `DRR` :

# runes, builds, spells, laning
- runes
	- [x] `pta` general
	- `lethal temp` vs 3+ tanks
- build
	- [x] `IE > collector > AS boots > ldr > BT/shieldbow > runaan` general
		- collector first item is ***really bad*** vs {3+ tanks / AS heavy adc}
- spells
	- `cleanse` vs ashe braum ..  heavy cc
	- `exhaust` vs draven, samira  .. burst
	- [x] `barrier` general

# laning
-  lvl 1 is ass
- [x] aphel is way better with `enchanter supp`, than with enagage/tank supp
	- cuz the first would help you sustain till late game, and focus on cs
- [x] best first buy is `BF sword > pick axe > 2 long swords`
- [x] the 4 guns combo
	- the idea is to have the 2 weapons only having `<=10 ammos`
	- great dps, but still rare to happen or hard to maintain
