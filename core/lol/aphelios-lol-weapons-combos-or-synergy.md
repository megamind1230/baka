- ***red white*** >> best for single target, melee dps || only good in 2 situations 
	- [x] can solo drake {if u have `BF sword`  or more }
	- [x] good in melee fights
		- [x] `red q` `white AA` till stacks are gone .. repeat
- ***green white***  >> best long range poke/ kiting / zoning  || best for single target, wide range dps
	- [x] wide range poke `white q AA` .. and you still switch to green for extra poke
		- notice that AA are a bit slow/delayed .. cuz must proc the green mark
			- way better to do these instead
				- if you are in green AA range .. it way better to do
					- [x] `white q green AA`  .. so switching to green would squeeze 1 more AA .. faster
				- [x] or get `5+ chakrams` .. and `just near AA`
- ***green purple*** >> setup and long range execute
	- `purple q green qR AA AA`
- ***blue white*** >> stack chakrams on minions 
	- `blue q` minions to get 1 chakram for each .. plus it's a fast wave clear
- ***blue red*** >> healing is still nerfed by riot
	-  `blue q` .. triggers `OHW` .. so it heals
- ***blue green*** >> see this note [[the-drr-the-daynean-rotation-rule-for-aphelios]]
