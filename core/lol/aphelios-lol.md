# rondo da sosa
-  best stats upgrades
	- `AD > L > AS` general
	- `AD > AS > L`  only vs tanky {supp + jg}
- `q` takes `10` ammos
- ***default*** weapons rotations 
	- `green > red` >,  `purple > blue`,  > `white`
	- ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ¥ ,  ðŸŸª ðŸŸ¦ ,  âšª
	- real names
		- ðŸŸ© calibrum {`calibration` (accuracy)}
		- ðŸŸ¥ severum {`several` shots} .. idk i just feel like it
		- ðŸŸª gravitum {`gravity`, slow, grounding roots}
		- ðŸŸ¦ infernum  {`infern` is flame}
		- âšª crescendum {`crescent`-shaped}
	- `e` spot shows what's next
# green
- range ~= cait range
- `q`
	- best early game poke/dps with animation cancel
		- `AA q` st `AA` st `AA`
	- invis n marked with `q` are revealed 
	- to check bushes

# red
- `AA` yasuo/samria behind their wall
- `q`
	- priorities n even if they are inside the wave .. ***careful to use it under n turret***
	- gives `MS`
	- locks all ur abilities

# purple
- `AA` slows .. so better hold on `q` if n escapes
- `q`
	- can activate `q` before it actually connects

# blue
- `AA` 
	- is 2nd safest weapon to poke with
- `q` 
	- longer range than `AA`

# white
- `AA` 
	- is slow from far, faster when close
	- cannot dps until they swing back
- chakrams 
	- `20` max
	- stacked with only `q` or `R`
		- lost 
			- after `5sec` .. unless reset with `AA` or whatever
			- against yasuo `wall` , samira `slash` , braum `shield`
	- [ ] best way to stack them ? #quest
- `q`
	- triggers `OHW`
	- good for zoning n / melee fights

# R
- can only `f R` âœ…
- `AOE` range is wider than you think
	- so `R` the close enemy to kill the far one
- triggers `main` weapon
	- green > quickly `qR AA AA`
	- red > better healing with more n
	- purple > set up roots for team
	- blue > ***best*** `AOE`, better with more n
	- white > ***2nd best***, only good for just stacking chakrams
		- 5 for first enemy being hit
			- 1 extra for each
			- so hitting 
				- 5 gives {`5 + 1*5 = 10`}
				- 3 gives {`5 + 1*3 = 8`}

# extras
- [x] the 4 guns combo
	- the idea is to have the 2 weapons only having `<=10 ammos`
	- great dps, but still rare to happen or hard to maintain

# laning
- before lvl 1 is ass
- [x] aphel is way better with `enchanter supp`, than with enagage/tank supp
	- cuz the first would help you sustain till late game, and focus on cs
- [x] best first buy is `BF sword > pick axe > 2 long swords`

# synergy
- 

# runes, builds, spells
- runes
	- [x] `pta` general
- build
	- [x] `IE > collector > AS boots > ldr > BT/shieldbow > runaan` general
- spells
	- `cleanse` vs ashe braum ..  heavy cc
	- `exhaust` vs draven, samira  .. burst
	- [x] `barrier` general
