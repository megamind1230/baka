# combos
dont overthink them
just break them down to the basic 3

## basic 3 combos
1. `q e`
	- for chasing
2. `e w`
	- for flashy gap close .. to burst a full combo
	- dodging skill shots
3. `w e`
	- for kiting / running

> notice that 
 u setup a dager
 and there is always `e`

the full combos are then stringing these together in a way


# tricks
## Q

-  q can throw dagger behind wall so you can go through wall
- q minions .. not to take aggro
## W
- w gives ghosting
- `we` for flashing csing
## E shunbo

- better E shunbo on enemy head to apply more damage
	- dont just pick the dagger next to them .. but make the correct jump to pick the dagger and do the E damage too

- E before the dagger lands = lower E cd
- E is AA reset
	- E does AA after by default
- always `E flash`

## R
- shows invisible targets
- deny cassio R  when on your R .. by just turning around when starting it
